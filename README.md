## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

```sh
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install plotly
```
# Contents
1. Estimation of Pi Using Monte Carlo Method:
This section estimates the value of œÄ using the Monte Carlo method by randomly generating points within a square and counting how many fall inside a quarter circle.
2. Dynamic Heart Shape Animation:
This section creates an animated heart shape using parametric equations and the Plotly library.
3. Plotting the Fibonacci Sequence:
This section calculates and plots the first 50 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using Matplotlib.

Instructions
Clone the repository:

```sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/aditya26062003/Visualization.git
Navigate to the repository directory:
```
```sh

cd Visualization
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```
```sh

jupyter notebook Shapes.ipynb
Run the cells in the notebook to see the visualizations and calculations.
```
# Examples
Estimation of Pi Using Monte Carlo Method
This part of the notebook uses random point generation to estimate the value of œÄ. The result is visualized with Plotly, showing points inside and outside the quarter circle.

Dynamic Heart Shape Animation
This part of the notebook creates a dynamic heart shape animation using parametric equations. The animation is created using Plotly and shows a heart shape "popping" in and out.

Plotting the Fibonacci Sequence
This part of the notebook calculates the first 50 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and plots them using Matplotlib.
